# Node-RED Dashboard Documentation

This document explains the Node-RED flow architecture for the sculpture control dashboard system.

## Overview

This Node-RED flow provides a web-based control interface for the sculpture audio system. It has been designed with a modular, maintainable structure where each component stays under 200 lines. The flow is organized into three main categories: **Core**, **System Control**, and **Sculpture Components**.

## Flow Management

The main `flow.json` file used by Node-RED is **auto-generated by Ansible** and should not be edited directly. The flows are built from smaller Jinja2 templates located in `flow_parts/`. These templates are assembled by the Ansible playbook during deployment.

### Making Changes

To modify the Node-RED flow:

1. Identify and edit the appropriate template file(s) in the `flow_parts/` directory
2. Run the main Ansible playbook to regenerate and deploy the `flow.json` file to the control node
3. Node-RED will automatically restart to apply changes

- Initial system state setup

### System Control Components

#### `plan_buttons.json.j2` (182 lines)
- Plan selection buttons (A1, A2, B1, B2, B3, etc.)
- Plan highlighting and state management
- MQTT broadcast to all sculptures

#### `plan_logic.json.j2` (73 lines)

### Sculpture Components (Per Sculpture: 1, 2, 3)

#### `mqtt_inputs.json.j2` (64 lines)
MQTT subscriptions for each sculpture:
- `sculpture/{id}/status` â†’ Status parser
- `sculpture/{id}/mode` â†’ Mode display
- `sculpture/{id}/mute` â†’ Mute state
- `sculpture/{id}/tracks` â†’ Track list updates

#### `controls.json.j2` (174 lines per sculpture)
Each sculpture gets:
- **UI Group**: Sculpture {id} group container
- **Volume Slider**: Master volume (0-1, 0.01 steps)
- **Capture Slider**: Capture level (0-1, 0.01 steps)
- **Mode Display**: Current operation mode
- **Mute Button**: Toggle mute state with visual feedback
- **Command Formatting**: JSON command preparation
- **MQTT Output**: Commands to `sculpture/{id}/cmd`

#### `tracks.json.j2` (66 lines per sculpture)
Each sculpture gets:
- **Track Dropdown**: Dynamic track selection
- **Load Button**: Load selected track
- **Track Logic**: Flow context management
- **Track List Updates**: Dynamic option population

#### `gauges.json.j2` (95 lines per sculpture)
Each sculpture gets 4 gauges:
- **CPU Gauge**: 0-100%, green/yellow/red zones (50%/80%)
- **Temperature Gauge**: 0-85Â°C, green/yellow/red zones (60Â°C/75Â°C)
- **Microphone Gauge**: -60 to 0 dB, red/yellow/green zones (-40/-20 dB)
- **Output Gauge**: -60 to 0 dB, red/yellow/green zones (-40/-20 dB)
- **Status Parser**: Routes incoming status to appropriate gauges

#### `restart_buttons.json.j2` (85 lines per sculpture)
Each sculpture gets restart buttons for:
- **Liquidsoap** (red background)
- **Darkice** (orange background)
- **Player Live** (blue background)
- **Player Loop** (purple background)
- **Reboot Pi** (dark red background)

## Benefits of This Architecture

### ðŸ”§ **Maintainability**
- Each component under 200 lines
- Single responsibility principle
- Easy to locate specific functionality

### ðŸš€ **Scalability** 
- Add new sculptures by incrementing loop
- Add new gauge types in single file
- Extend system controls independently

### ðŸ§ª **Testability**
- Test individual components in isolation
- Clear separation of concerns
- Predictable data flow

### ðŸ“š **Documentation**
- Self-documenting structure
- Component purpose clear from filename
- Logical grouping of related functionality

### ðŸ”„ **Reusability**
- Sculpture components are templates
- System components can be extended
- Core components are foundational

## Adding New Features

### New Sculpture Component
1. Create new file in `sculpture/` directory
2. Use Jinja2 loop: `{% for sculpture_id in [1, 2, 3] %}`
3. Add include to main `flow.json.j2`

### New System Feature
1. Create new file in `system/` directory
2. Add include to main `flow.json.j2`
3. Update UI group order as needed

### New Core Feature  
1. Create new file in `core/` directory
2. Add include to main `flow.json.j2`
3. Consider startup sequence timing
