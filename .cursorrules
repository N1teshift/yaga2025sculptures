# Cursor Rules for yaga2025sculptures Project

## File Management

### File Length Preference
- **Keep files under 200 lines when possible**: This makes it easier and faster for AI agents to edit files directly
- **Refactor large files**: If a file exceeds 200 lines, consider breaking it into smaller, focused modules
- **Exception**: Only avoid refactoring if it doesn't make logical sense (e.g., would create unnecessary complexity or break cohesion)

## Terminal Access & Command Execution

### WSL Ubuntu Terminal Access
- **Full command execution permission**: AI agents are authorized to execute commands on the WSL Ubuntu terminal without requiring approval for each action
- **Sudo commands**: When using sudo commands, agents should proceed without asking for password confirmation from the user
- **Target environment**: Commands should be executed in the Ubuntu WSL instance where the project services run
- **Transparency**: Agents should still inform the user what commands they're running and why, but don't need to wait for approval
- **Purpose**: This enables agents to check system status, diagnose issues, and perform maintenance tasks independently

### SSH Access to Raspberry Pi Devices
- **SSH permission**: AI agents can SSH to the Raspberry Pi sculpture devices for remote command execution
- **Device information**: IPs and connection details are defined in `edge/ansible/hosts.ini`
  - sculpture1: 192.168.8.158
  - sculpture2: 192.168.8.155
  - sculpture3: 192.168.8.157
- **SSH configuration**: Use `pi` user with SSH key `~/.ssh/id_rsa`
- **Remote sudo**: Agents can execute sudo commands on the Pi devices without password confirmation
- **Purpose**: Enables remote diagnostics, service management, and system maintenance on sculpture devices

### Ansible Deployment Restrictions
- **Do NOT run ansible commands**: AI agents should never execute ansible-playbook or other ansible commands
- **User controls deployment**: Only the user should run ansible deployments
- **Reminder only**: Agents can remind or mention that it's time to run ansible, but should not attempt to do it themselves
- **Purpose**: Ensures user maintains control over deployment to production systems
